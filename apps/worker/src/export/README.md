# export

Board deliverables from Circuit JSON. Pure functions: no DB, no model calls.

```ts
import { buildDeliverables, zipDeliverables, zipFabrication } from "./deliverables.js"

const d = await buildDeliverables({ circuitJson, name: "finale", specId, specText, source, result, harnessVersion })
d.files      // path -> string | Uint8Array
d.manifest   // { name, spec_id, generated_at, metrics, files: [{ path, category, description, mime, bytes }] }
d.skipped    // exporters that failed, with the reason (the rest are still valid)
zipDeliverables(d, "finale")   // everything, under finale/
zipFabrication(d)              // Gerbers + drill only, flat: what a board house wants
```

CLI: `npm run export finale` (any reference board or spec id), or `npm run export -- --json board.circuit.json name`.
Writes `out/<name>/`, `out/<name>-deliverables.zip` and `out/<name>-gerbers.zip`. About 6 s for the finale.

## Front end

The `boards` collection already stores `circuit_json`, so deliverables can be built on demand; nothing extra is stored.
Suggested Next.js route (Node runtime, not Edge: `@resvg/resvg-js` is native):

- `GET /api/boards/:id/deliverables` → `manifest.json` (list files, show metrics)
- `GET /api/boards/:id/deliverables?file=<path>` → one file with its `mime`
- `GET /api/boards/:id/deliverables.zip` → `zipDeliverables`; `?only=gerbers` → `zipFabrication`

The report includes hidden-check failure details; that's fine for people, but never feed deliverables back to the agents.
