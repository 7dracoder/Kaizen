// Auth.js (NextAuth v5) wiring: real accounts, database sessions stored in FalkorDB (lib/auth-adapter.ts).
//
// Google for most sign-ins, email magic links (via Resend) for anyone without a Google
// account — Resend is optional; a Google-only deployment is still "configured" (see
// authConfigured below) and only registers the Google provider. With no provider configured
// at all, the app runs in anonymous mode.
//
// trustHost is the *local-dev* fallback: Auth.js reads it only when AUTH_URL isn't set,
// and falls back to building callback and magic-link URLs from the request's Host header.
// That's fine on localhost, but in production set AUTH_URL explicitly (.env.example) —
// otherwise a forged Host header behind a misconfigured proxy could put an attacker's
// domain into a real user's magic-link email.
